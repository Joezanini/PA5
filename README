List.c - A multi-purpose List ADT that implements
         a bi-directional queue of ints in the
         form of a doubly linked list data structure.
            
List.h - Header file for List.c

Graph.c - A Graph ADT that creates adjacency list 
          representations of graphs, which consists of 
          an array of Lists. Each List corresponds to a 
          vertex in the graph and gives the neighbors of 
          that vertex.

Graph.h - Header file for Graph.c

GraphTest.c - A file used solely for testing the Graph ADT.

FindComponents.c - Uses the Graph ADT to find strongly connected 
	     components of graph using DFS.
